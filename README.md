# Simple Go Web Server

This code was written based on a tutorial by Akhil Sharma on 
freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFfo23yIWac)).

**NOTE**: some code may be different especially in the GORM part since I found
the [official docs](https://gorm.io/docs/connecting_to_the_database.html)
different.
