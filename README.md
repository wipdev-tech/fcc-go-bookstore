# Simple Go Web Server

This code was written based on a tutorial by Akhil Sharma on 
freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFfo23yIWac)).

**NOTE**: some code may be different especially in the GORM part since I found
the [official docs](https://gorm.io/docs/connecting_to_the_database.html)
different.

## Comments

Overall, I'm not sure how I feel about this... I've been introduced to a lot of
stuff together, so I can't put my hand exactly on what I do and don't like.
However, I'm certainly not feeling great about the way this code structure is
very similar the one generated by MVC Frameworks like Django and Laravel. I
came to Go because of its simplicity, not to replicate what other languages
have already abstracted.

Also, this is the first time I see GORM, but this tutorial doesn't do much with
it. As far as I know, the Go community doesn't prefer ORMs. However, a little
introduction wouldn't hurt.
